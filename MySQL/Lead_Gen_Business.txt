1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?

    SELECT SUM(amount)
    FROM billing
    WHERE charged_datetime > '2012-03-01 00:00:00' AND charged_datetime < '2012-04-01 00:00:00'


2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?

    SELECT SUM(amount)
    FROM billing
    WHERE client_id = '2'


3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client=10 owns?

    SELECT domain_name
    FROM sites
    WHERE client_id = '10'


4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client=20?

    SELECT YEAR(created_datetime), COUNT(*) AS Created_In_Year, COUNT(*)/12 AS AVG_Created_Per_Month
    FROM sites
    WHERE client_id = '20'
    GROUP BY YEAR(created_datetime)


5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?

    SELECT sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id)
    FROM sites
    JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE leads.registered_datetime > '2011-01-01 00:00:00' AND leads.registered_datetime < '2011-02-16 00:00:00'
    GROUP BY sites.domain_name

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?

    SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(*) AS leads_originated
    FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE leads.registered_datetime > '2011-01-01 00:00:00' AND leads.registered_datetime < '2012-01-01 00:00:00'
    GROUP BY clients.client_id

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?

    SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(*) AS leads_originated
    FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) < '7' AND MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) >= '1' AND YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = '2011'
    GROUP BY clients.client_id

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.

    SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(*) AS leads_originated
    FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    WHERE YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = '2011'
    GROUP BY sites.site_id
    ORDER BY clients.client_id

    SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, sites.domain_name, COUNT(*) AS leads_originated
    FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    LEFT JOIN leads ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
    GROUP BY sites.site_id
    ORDER BY clients.client_id

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.

    SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, SUM(billing.amount), MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime)
    FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN billing ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
    GROUP BY MONTH(charged_datetime)
    ORDER BY clients.client_id

        Note:
        Question was ambiguous to if they wanted per month per year orpermonth for all years/given year. I interpreted it as trying to decern what month each client tends to be most active.

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that each row shows a new client. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

    SELECT clients.client_id, clients.first_name, clients.last_name, GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT sites.domain_name SEPARATOR', ')
    FROM clients
    LEFT JOIN sites ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
    GROUP BY clients.client_id
